# SunGod Frontend Developer Task
This task is designed to assess your ability to follow a brief and work independently to produce high quality work. 

You must not spend more than 45 minutes on this task. We're not expecting complete implementation, and the degree of completion will vary around experience level. We're more interested in you showcasing best practices and attention to detail, rather than completing the whole task poorly. Treat it like you would any production code.

## The Brief
The component `Stories.vue` has been created to showcase up to three of our recent stories (blog posts) at a time and will be included in various places over the site to encourage visitors to continue exploring our site, we need you to style it.

Please take inspiration from the existing SunGod styling shown on our [site](https://www.sungod.co/) but feel free to add your own flair - subtle animations and interactivity hints may be welcome, if you think they are appropriate.


## Task
- Clone this repository.
- Update the author field in `package.json` and commit your changes, this starts the 45 minute period.
- Style `Stories.vue`, any other components and make any changes you feel necessary.
- When you are done or your time is up please commit your changes.
- Bundle your work and send it to us: `git bundle create sungod.bundle main`


## Nuxt
```bash
# install dependencies
